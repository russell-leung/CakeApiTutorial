Examples
========

We realize the JSON API document structure can be complex and hard to memorize which is exactly why we have decided to use
pure JSON API documents as fixtures for our integration tests. This not only assures crud-json-api will behave exactly as we
expect, it also provides you with a reference directory you can use to lookup fully-functional examples of:

- `JsonApiRequestBodies <https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/crud-json-api/tree/master/tests/Fixture/JsonApiRequestBodies>`_:, the JSON API bodies used when Creating or Updating Resources
- `JsonApiResponseBodies <https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/crud-json-api/tree/master/tests/Fixture/JsonApiResponseBodies>`_:, the JSON API responses crud-json-api will produce
